# CYK Algorithm Project

## Live Demo

https://cyk-algorithm.netlify.app/

## Overview

This project implements the CYK (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) algorithm for parsing context-free grammars. It includes a user interface built with React TSX using the Shadcn component library, which communicates with a Python-based CYK algorithm deployed on AWS Lambda through an API Gateway.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for entering grammars and words to be parsed
- CYK algorithm implementation for determining if a word can be generated by a given grammar
- Secure communication with the CYK algorithm via AWS Lambda API Gateway

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/substro/CYK-Algorithm
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
cd CYK-Algorithm
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

## Usage

1. Enter a context-free grammar in the provided input field.
2. Enter a word to be parsed by the grammar.
3. Click the "Check Result" button to initiate the CYK algorithm.
4. The result will be displayed indicating whether the word can be generated by the grammar or not.
